# Creating a new project

```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```

This command uses create-next-app, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the --example flag with the [starter example](https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example) for this course.
